Introduction
------------
The minetest_game gamemode offers multiple new possibilities in addition to Minetest's built-in API, allowing you to
add new plants to farming mod, buckets for new liquids, new stairs and custom panes.
For information on the Minetest API, visit https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/doc/lua_api.txt

	^ Explanation for line above

Bucket API
----------
The bucket API allows registering new types of buckets for non-default liquids.

	bucket.register_liquid(
		"default:lava_source",		-- Source node name
		"default:lava_flowing",		-- Flowing node name
		"bucket:bucket_lava",		-- Name to be used for bucket
		"bucket_lava.png",			-- Bucket texture (for wielditem and inventory_image)
		"Lava Bucket"				-- Bucket description
	)
	
Doors API
---------
The doors mod allows modders to register custom doors.

	doors:register_door(name, def)
	^ Notice the ":" instaed of "."!
	^ name: "Door name"
	^ def: See [#Door definition]
	
#Door definition
----------------
{
	description = "Door description",
	inventory_image = "mod_door_inv.png",
	groups = {group = 1},
	tiles_bottom: [Tile definition],
	^ the tiles of the bottom part of the door {front, side}
	tiles_top: [Tile definition],
	^ the tiles of the bottom part of the door {front, side}
	node_box_bottom = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	node_box_top = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	selection_box_bottom = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	selection_box_top = regular nodebox, see [Node boxes], OPTIONAL,
	only_placer_can_open = true/false,
	^ If true, only placer can open the door (locked for others)
}

Farming API
-----------
The farming API allows you to easily register plants and hoes.

farming.register_hoe(name, hoe definition)
 -> Register a new hoe, see [#hoe definition]
 
farming.register_plant(name, Plant definition)
 -> Register a new growing plant, see [#Plant definition]

#Hoe Definition
---------------
{
	description = "",	-- Description for tooltip
	inventory_image = "unknown_item.png",	-- Image to be used as wield- and inventory image
	max_uses = 30,	-- Uses until destroyed
	recipe = {	-- Craft recipe
		{"air", "air", "air"},
		{"", "group:stick"},
		{"", "group:stick"},
	}
}

#Plant definition
-----------------
{
	description = "",	-- Description of seed item
	inventory_image = "unknown_item.png",	-- Image to be used as seed's wield- and inventory image
	steps = 8,	-- How many steps the plant has to grow, until it can be harvested
	^ Always provide a plant texture for ech step, format: modname_plantname_i.png (i = stepnumber)
	minlight = 13, -- Minimum light to grow
	maxlight = LIGHT_MAX -- Maximum light to grow
}
